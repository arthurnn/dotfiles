# arthurnnâ€™s dotfiles

## Fork

This is not a full fork, but was havily based on dotfiles from [mathiasbynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles).


## Installation

### Using Git and the bootstrap script

You can clone the repository wherever you want. (I like to keep it in `~/dev/dotfiles`) The bootstrapper script will pull in the latest version and copy the files to your home folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arthurnn/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && source bootstrap.sh
```

To update, `cd` into your local `dotfiles` repository and then:

```bash
source bootstrap.sh
```
