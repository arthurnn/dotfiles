# arthurnnâ€™s dotfiles

## Installation

### Using Git and the setup script

You can clone the repository wherever you want. (I like to keep it in `~/src/dotfiles`) The bootstrapper script will pull in the latest version and link the files to your home folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arthurnn/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && script/setup
```
